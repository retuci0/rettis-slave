    "thermite": """
ingredients:
- rust (aka ferric oxide), finely powder. you can obtain by performing electrolysis on water with iron objects
- finely powdered aluminum
- magnesium strip (for ignition)
- ceramic pot. glass will essentially make it a nail bomb.
1. grind the rust and aluminum if you haven't already
2. mix them in a 1:1 ratio
3. pour the mixture into the ceramic pot
4. add the magnesium strip and light it up. it will produce a very bright white light.
5. run away because it will burn at 2500 degrees celsius, which when translated to shoot shooting is like 4000 fahrenheir or however the fuck it's spelt.
