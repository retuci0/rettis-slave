    "gunpowder": r"""
ingredients: charcoal, saltpeter and sulfur.
1. let all the materials dry.
2. grind all the ingredients SEPARATELY in a mortar with a pestle
3. mix 75% saltpeter 15% charcoal and 10% sulphur. it's recommended to add an extra 6% water
4. let the mixture dry
to use it:
1. get a fuse (a dry piece of cloth or a thin rope will do)
2. put some gunpowder in a tightly closed recipient
3. add the fuse
4. light it up
5. run (optional)

    "thermite": """
ingredients:
- rust (aka ferric oxide), finely powder. you can obtain by performing electrolysis on water with iron objects
- finely powdered aluminum
- magnesium strip (for ignition)
- ceramic pot. glass will essentially make it a nail bomb.
1. grind the rust and aluminum if you haven't already
2. mix them in a 1:1 ratio
3. pour the mixture into the ceramic pot
4. add the magnesium strip and light it up. it will produce a very bright white light.
5. run away because it will burn at 2500 degrees celsius, which when translated to shoot shooting is like 4000 fahrenheir or however the fuck it's spelt.

    "smokebomb": """
Did you know you can create a very powerful smoke bomb with just two ingredients? Yes, this is true, but it's a little bit more complicated like this. Rocket fuel also works like this. The two ingredients are saltpeter (KNO3) and sugar (C12H22O11), but you can also add some baking soda (NaHCO3) to aid in smoke production and to make the mixture burn for a little bit longer. In this mixture, the saltpeter works as an oxidising agent, while the sugar works as an excellent fuel. So, you will need the following materials:

Sugar (C12H22O11)
Saltpeter or potassium nitrate (KNO3)
Baking soda or sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) (optional)
A toilet paper roll tube
A fuse
A non-stick pan
Any object to stir
Any fire-producer artefact, such as a lighter or some matches
Duct tape

… And to follow the steps listed below:

1. Add 60 gr. of saltpeter and 40 gr. of sugar to the pan. You can also add from 5 to 10 gr. of baking soda if you want. If you don't have enough sugar or saltpeter, just remember to stick to the ratio: 3:2.

2. Put the heat on as low as it will go. This prevents any unwanted accidents from happening.

3. Stir the mixture. Stir continuously, but not vigorously, to prevent the material from burning. After about 10 minutes, you will notice that the powder starts to flow a bit like water. This happens because the sugar is caramelising.

5. Once the mixture looks like peanut butter (brown and soggy), take it off the pan and pour it into a duct-taped toilet paper roll tube. Remember to seal properly the bottom of the tube, to prevent any loss of this mixture.

6. Add the fuse to the mixture. If you don't have one, you can directly light the mixture, even though it is more dangerous to do.

10KNO3 + 3C12H22O11 + 8NaHCO3 → 5H2O + 6CO2 + 4N2 + 8Na2CO3 + K2O
