# rettibot aka retti's slave
> src of my overly aggressive bot

## commands
prefix is $:

- help: what do you think this does moron. use $help (command) for more info.
- sex: sexes people
- recipe: sends recipes for "stuff"
- rape: uses the dlink 9.8 critical score thingy on an ip address.
- ship: ships 2 people and returns a random percentage. the generated percentages are persistent.
- togglelogger: toggles the message logger. needs admin to run.
- balance: shows your current ballance in retdollars (R$)
- cf / coinflip: flips a coin for a 50-50 chance of winning or losing. specify the amount you want to gamble and either lose it all or double it.
- gift: transfers the desired amount of money to the desired user (usage: `$gift <user> <amount>)
- bless: summons money out of thin air and gives it to someone. requires admin.
- afk: sets you as "afk".

if command returns "uh oh" means it errored the fuck out.

## other stuff it can do

- nothing much else but has a message logger, can be toggled with `$togglelogger`

## usage
1. clone the repo
2. create a new file called `super_secret_token.py` and add `TOKEN = <your bot token>` in there. obviously replace <your bot token> with your actual bot's token.
if you don't know how to make a bot i won't explain that to you
3. run main.py

## notes

- recipes command won't work because you have to add your own recipes. github doesn't like me adding my own.
- there's some user ids left it there. if it bothers you just delete them or replace them.
